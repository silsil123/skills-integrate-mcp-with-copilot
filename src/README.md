## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.

## Static Web UI

A simple web interface is available at [http://localhost:8000/static/index.html](http://localhost:8000/static/index.html).

## Notes

- All data is stored in memory and will be lost when the server restarts.
- Python 3.7+ is required.
- For all dependencies, you can also run:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
